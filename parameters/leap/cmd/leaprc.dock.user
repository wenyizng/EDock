# DOCK Amber Score User Commands for LEaP
#  This provides a hook into the amberization scripts.
#  All these commands will be sourced by tleap in all the amberize scripts.
#  For example, one could define a new atom type and load its parameters:
#  This merely prevents unknown atom type and maybe hybridization
#  comments from LEaP.
#  addAtomTypes {
#     { "Si"  "Si" "sp3" }
#  }
#  
#  Define the atom types and parameters for Tetrahedrally Bonded Silicon.
#  silicon = loadamberparams frcmod.dock.silicon
